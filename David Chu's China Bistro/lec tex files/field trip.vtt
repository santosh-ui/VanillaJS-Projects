2
00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:06.560
Okay.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.330
We're ready to go on our field trip.

4
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.280
We will meet Amy, the owner of the
restaurant, who will be creating a website

5
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.610
for in a sense of what she wants in her
website, and maybe even get lucky and

6
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.798
interview some customers to get a unique
perspective about the restaurant.

7
00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:22.296
Let's go.

[MUSIC]

9
00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:28.260
When you get right down to it, this
really is all about setting expectations.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.360
Whether it's expectations about what
the client is expecting from us or

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.380
our expectations of what
the client is going to provide.

12
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.200
So, if we can achieve that of
communicating those expectations very

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.390
clearly, we've done our job.

14
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.242
Seriously, how many
computer science courses do

15
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.712
you have to take you on a field trip?

21
00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:24.961
>> David Chu's how can I help you?

22
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.962
>> [MUSIC]

23
00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:30.219
>> Yeah, I come to this restaurant very
often, usually about once a month or

24
00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.910
twice a month.

25
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.090
>> I would come here once
a month with my wife.

26
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.500
>> I always enjoy the atmosphere and
I enjoy the service.

27
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.730
>> I like the fact that it's Kosher.

28
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.580
And the fact that the food is very
good all the time, consistently good.

29
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.440
So that's why I like to
come to this restaurant.

30
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.770
>> Me, personally, I always eat chicken,
that's my favorite dish.

31
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.478
>> And I can also, when I don't finish
much ample portions, I can take home.

32
00:01:51.478 --> 00:01:52.934
Tastes good.

33
00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:55.580
[LAUGH] I mean that's why I like it.

34
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.010
It's the type of thing which I
expect a good Chinese dish to have.

35
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.540
>> I love the chicken itself,
I just love the way it's made.

36
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.546
I enjoy it.

37
00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:06.950
>> Have you ever heard of Johns
Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering?

38
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.380
>> Of course.

39
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.040
>> You think it's a good school?

40
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.320
>> It's absolutely a good school.

41
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.810
>> The food is exceptional, and
I know it's Zagat rated, so

42
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.900
I can always trust that the food is
going to be fresh and ready to eat.

43
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.660
And, I always enjoy it.

44
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.310
>> Joseph Rosenblatt,
class of 1964, Hopkins.

45
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.240
>> So you actually went to Hopkins?

46
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.297
>> Yep.

>> Hi.
>> Ready for our meeting?

49
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.310
>> Sure.
[MUSIC]

50
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.857
>> So
if you had to do a little self-criticism,

51
00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:44.620
Is there anything about the restaurant
you would want to improve?

52
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.570
>> Yes, to get a better website.

53
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.927
>> Get a better website,
that's a very good answer.

54
00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:50.960
[LAUGH]
>> Thank you.

55
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.500
>> Okay, so what I did was I
prepared a few websites for

56
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.900
you to look at and what I want you to do
is, I've pulled them up on this iPad here.

57
00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.880
What I want you to do
is take a look at them.

58
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.960
And let me know, these are all
sites of Chinese restaurants.

59
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.830
And take a look and
see if you like any of them and

60
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.605
if you want your website to be kind of
similar or something like that.

61
00:03:11.605 --> 00:03:12.190
>> Sure.

62
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.000
>> And you can scroll back and
forth over here and take a look.

63
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.800
And if you do like it,
what do you like about it?

64
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.190
What appeals to you about that website?

65
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.900
Or what doesn't?

66
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.490
What do you not want to
come out of that website?

67
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.350
What do you like about it?

68
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.190
>> The colors.

69
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.100
>> You like the colors?

70
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.340
You like the colors.

71
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.290
>> Very clear.

72
00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.690
>> You like the fact that it's clean and
looking very clean, okay.

73
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.451
>> Yeah.
>> Okay.

74
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:36.668
>> And the item are very,
very user-friendly.

75
00:03:36.668 --> 00:03:37.483
>> User-friendly?

76
00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.020
Looks very user-friendly to you?

77
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.330
Okay, so this site looks very
user-friendly to you, okay.

78
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.020
>> Yeah.

79
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.680
>> And it looks clean.

80
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.960
>> Very practical.

81
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.260
>> Very practical, okay.

82
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.200
Very good, very good.

83
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.633
So you like,
this the type of site you would like.

84
00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:48.830
Okay, that's good.

85
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.020
Is this something like, obviously we're
not going to do these colors for your

86
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.450
website, because your website is going to
be more with the colors of the restaurant.

87
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.440
>> Of course, I mean, I understand.

88
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.680
>> But you like this setup.

89
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.240
>> Yeah.

90
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.830
>> So we're going to have some decisions
to make as we go and develop the website.

91
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.030
You know, we're a good thing,
stuff like that.

92
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.660
Can you designate one person
who's going to be responsible for

93
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.500
all decisions regarding this project?

94
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.490
And who would that person be?

95
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.830
>> It would be me.

96
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.470
>> It'd be you, so
it be you who's deciding.

97
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.190
And you're pretty much available so we can
call you if there's something going on and

98
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.170
there shouldn't be a two-week type
of wait before we hear an answer.

99
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.590
We need something for a decision.

100
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.900
So you'll be able to decide?

101
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.690
>> Yeah, no problem.

102
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.420
>> Okay, great, very good.

103
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.260
So we can do that.

104
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.930
So let me explain to you a couple of
what the process is going to be like.

105
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.770
Basically, we're going to create a mockup
of the website, not the real website.

106
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.520
So just a mock-up,
a drawing of the website.

107
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.370
And we're going to show it to you and

108
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.810
basically see if you approve
of the way it's going.

109
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.150
And we'll give you three revisions,
three times

110
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.990
that you can update the thing and say,
I want something different a little bit.

111
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.540
And after that, you'll try to finalize it.

112
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.340
Are you okay with that?

113
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.500
You're okay with that type of setup?

114
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.130
>> Yes.
That's fine.

115
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.000
>> Okay, great. Okay.
You saw the pictures on that website and

116
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.980
you really like the fact that
there's pictures on there, right?

117
00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.570
>> Yes.
>> So

118
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.470
pictures that have usually, especially,
a website like this is very important.

119
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.290
Would you be able to commit to providing
the entire menu of the restaurant?

120
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.930
So, we could come and
bring a photographer and

121
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.940
actually take a picture of
every single item on the menu.

122
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.530
Would you be okay with doing that?

123
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.082
>> Yeah, as long as still be kosher menu-

124
00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:17.600
>> [LAUGH]
>> That's fine.

125
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.632
>> It'll still be a kosher menu, yes.

126
00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:19.810
>> [LAUGH]
>> Absolutely.

127
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.410
Okay, so very good.

128
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.990
So we'll bring a photographer in, and then
you'll basically have to cook every single

129
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.110
item in the menu, and we'll bring it out
and the photographer will take a picture.

130
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.830
>> Sure, that's fine.

131
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.390
>> Okay, excellent.

132
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.030
Very good.

133
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.330
So this is a Kosher restaurant,
is that correct?

134
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.130
>> Yes.
>> Kosher restaurant?

135
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.020
>> We're Kosher.

136
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.500
>> And so what does that you know,
in terms of cooking and

137
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.460
if there's a dealing with stuff.

138
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.650
What does that mean for you?

139
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.050
>> We have a [INAUDIBLE] here.

140
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.210
>> You have somebody who is a supervisor.

141
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.260
>> Yeah, nowadays, people start making
a lot of ingredients with a Kosher logo.

142
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.750
So that means we have a lot of choices.

143
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.790
>> So I spoke to quite a number of
customers that you have here and

144
00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:00.550
not everybody wanted to be on camera,
but everybody loves your food.

145
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.030
>> Thank you.

146
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.250
>> Do you like chinese food yourself?

147
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:06.140
>> Of course.

148
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.670
>> Do you eat all the chinese food a lot?

149
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.930
>> Of course.

150
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.491
>> Really, okay.

151
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:11.379
>> [LAUGH] I'm a Chinese.

152
00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:12.679
>> So you're not sick of it.
So you're not sick of it.

153
00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:14.110
>> No, not at all.

154
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.750
>> So you eat it,

155
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.080
even though you see it everyday in
the restaurant you're not sick of it.

156
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.990
>> No, not at all.

157
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.490
>> Okay good.
>> I never get tired of chinese food.

158
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.930
>> This restaurant is
actually pretty cozy.

159
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.180
And it's small-
>> Thank you.

160
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.070
>> But at the same time it feels
kind of cozy, it's relaxing, right.

161
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.780
Is that kind of the feel
you're trying to go for?

162
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.830
>> Yeah.
>> On purpose?

163
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.180
>> Yeah.

164
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.480
>> Okay, so now we're ready
to leave the restaurant and

165
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.630
start designing and coding our website.

166
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.106
But before we do,
one of the most important rules is,

167
00:06:42.106 --> 00:06:45.497
don't ever code on an empty stomach.

168
00:06:45.497 --> 00:06:47.950
I know you really are anxious
to start coding the website.

169
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.520
But I'm a little busy.

170
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.670
So I'll be right back.

171
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:55.587
[MUSIC].

00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:57.338
We'll do the website after this.

173
00:06:57.338 --> 00:07:00.087
[MUSIC].

174
00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:04.480
I don't know what my line was.

175
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.740
[LAUGH].
>> I'm going to put this in bloopers.

176
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.796
>> [LAUGH].

177
00:07:10.796 --> 00:07:11.461
>> Okay.

178
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:12.212
And your line was?

179
00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:12.796
What's it called?

180
00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:14.170
>> I don't why I got into computers.

181
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.243
Food tasting seems like a much better job.

182
00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:20.146
Anyway.

183
00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:24.615
[LAUGH]
Okay,

184
00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:29.087
one second.

185
00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:35.150
Think so, you do it like this?

186
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.695
It's hard to do it this way.

187
00:07:37.695 --> 00:07:40.360
>> [LAUGH]
>> It's two fingers.

188
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.390
>> Two fingers.
>> Instead of ten fingers.

189
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.730
>> Two fingers instead of ten fingers?

190
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.450
>> Yes.

191
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.250
Okay.

192
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.840
>> Just hold it with two fingers?

193
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.570
>> Yeah.

194
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.070
>> Like this?

195
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.100
This is very hard.

196
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.830
>> Put the, bring this finger here,
in the middle.

197
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.590
>> Put the middle finger in
between those two fingers?

198
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.950
>> Yeah.

199
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.360
>> Like this?
>> Yeah.

200
00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.753
And then try to [CROSSTALK].

201
00:07:58.753 --> 00:08:00.070
>> And then you have to grab it like that?

202
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.010
>> Yeah, exactly.

203
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.695
You're good.

204
00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:03.900
Uh-huh.

205
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.870
Yeah.
>> Let me ask you a question,

206
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.085
do you have a fork?

207
00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:11.780
[LAUGH]
>> This is much better than a fork.

208
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.740
>> This is much better than a fork?

209
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.860
>> Can you pick up a rice with a fork?

210
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.570
>> No.

211
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.360
>> Can you?

212
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.960
>> But I can do it with a spoon.

213
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.770
>> See I can pick up
rice with a chopstick.

214
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.270
>> You can pickup rice with a chopstick,
let's see it.

215
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.260
Wow, that's some skill.

216
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.810
Let's see if I can do it,
I can pick up a carrot, it's much bigger.

217
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.980
>> Much better, good job.

218
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.700
>> Wow, look at this, look at this.

219
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.560
I'm learning, this is incredible, okay.

220
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.765
Next, I'm going to do the rice, ready?

221
00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:38.394
>> Uh-huh.

222
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:41.620
Good.

223
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.820
>> My goodness.

224
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.400
>> Good job.
>> At the same time I have to eat this.

225
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.953
Right?
>> Yeah.

226
00:08:44.953 --> 00:08:47.111
>> It's had to balance and
eat it at the same time.

227
00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:48.510
>> Yeah.
>> It takes some skill.

228
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.740
>> Good job.

229
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.710
There you go.

230
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.990
>> Tastes much better from the chopsticks.

231
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.754
>> You're a good student.
>> [LAUGH]
