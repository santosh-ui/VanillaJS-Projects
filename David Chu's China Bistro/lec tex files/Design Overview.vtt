00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.525
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.525 --> 00:00:09.583
Okay, so, now we're back from the
restaurant and I really feel that I was

3
00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:13.480
able to get a taste of this
project up close and personal.

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.740
Now, now what we're going to do now is
we're going to go of our design overview

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.610
and this is a combination of work that,

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.870
the graphic designer ie my wife did for
us.

7
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.580
And we're going to see how this is
going to evolve into a real website.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.520
So let's go ahead and jump into it.

9
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.700
So when you're first starting
to design a website,

10
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.670
the worst thing you could possibly
do is start coding right away.

11
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.380
You don't want to do that.

12
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.960
You don't want to design a website
coding it at the same time.

13
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.220
What you do want to do is you want to
have some mock ups, some layout mock ups,

14
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.330
that you present to the client that
take little to no time to design and

15
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.400
to put together and present to the client.

16
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.380
And once they approve, and
you know exactly what you're coding,

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.460
of what you're trying to strive for
then you turn to the code editor and

18
00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.960
you start coding the website.

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.170
So what we're going to do is
design the mock ups first.

20
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.750
So the tool we're going to
use is called balsamiq.com.

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.460
It's a balsamiq mock up tool, and
it lets us put together mock ups for

22
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.480
websites for other different UIs very,

23
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.400
very quickly and I'll show you
the cool part about it in a minute.

24
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.150
So let's go ahead and

25
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.800
switch to Balsamiq mock up, I'll provide
you the link to them in the resources.

26
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.290
So here's our Balsamiq mock up, we
finished the website layout already with

27
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.993
the help of the graphic designer,
ie my wife.

28
00:01:29.993 --> 00:01:32.745
And before we want to actually design
let me just say a couple of words

29
00:01:32.745 --> 00:01:33.910
about this tool.

30
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.560
This tool is not free but
it's really not that expensive.

31
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.980
However, what's really cool about this
tool, besides for the fact that it has

32
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.440
components for different platforms that
you're able to neatly lay them out.

33
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.180
You also have an integration
of components from

34
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.680
Bootstrap which is exactly what we're
going to use, so it's really convenient.

35
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.690
But I think one of the coolest features
of this tool for us as coders,

36
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.390
is that all these mock
ups are based upon a file

37
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.980
than is really nothing more than
HTML looking like, text file.

38
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.520
It means that you could check
things in into a code repository.

39
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.002
And when things get updated,
it's just the text that gets updated.

40
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:15.760
So unlike images and

41
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.650
things that really are impossible to
deal with inside repositories, and

42
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.200
there's no way to tell what the difference
is because it's not text, it's binary.

43
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.250
This is all text-based, and
therefore, you could take and

44
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.150
create a difference between what was
checked in at the repository yesterday

45
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.130
versus today,
versus is going to be tomorrow.

46
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.360
And it's huge, huge advantage when you're
working especially within a team, and

47
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.240
in a professional environment.

48
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.536
Okay, so let's take a look at our website
here that we, the mock up of the website.

49
00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:49.660
So the mock up is, it's going to have
a logo with some text underneath, and

50
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.880
this is going to be basically our menu.

51
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.650
And I'm not sure 100% yet
If that's what the menu items will be,

52
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.840
definitely there will be a menu item,
right?

53
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.090
The menu menu for
the food menu that we're going to have.

54
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.180
And there's the phone number
with a little thing, we deliver.

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.510
Now, this big area, what's planned for

56
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.140
this is some kind of a picture
of the inside of the restaurant.

57
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.890
It's going to be what's called
a jumbotron In Bootstrap.

58
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.770
So when the user first gets in here, he
sees a very nice picture of the restaurant

59
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
and it's inviting and
they want to kind of proceed.

60
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.598
What's going to be underneath is three
giant buttons, Menu, Specials, and a Map.

61
00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:29.250
And it's self-explanatory what it stands
for and these are kind of the key

62
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.060
things that we want the user of
this website to see right away.

63
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.920
Which is they want to see the menu,
perhaps specials, and

64
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.130
certainly where this is located.

65
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.980
At the bottom we're going to have Hours,
some budget quotes or

66
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.430
a couple of quotes about the restaurant,
and

67
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.660
we're going to have the actual
address of the restaurant as well.

68
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.300
Now remember,
this is going to be a responsive website.

69
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.420
So we need to design what
the site will look like

70
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.890
when the browser page gets
a little more narrow.

71
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.590
So the first one is going to be a tablet.

72
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.170
So what happens when you're in a tablet?

73
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.040
Well not much happens when you're in
a tablet in this particular design.

74
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.260
Because we're just going
to squeeze different items,

75
00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.230
as opposed to before that's
going to kind of spread out.

76
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.760
And then we're just going to kind of
squeeze them a little bit more and

77
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.540
still have the jumbotron and
still have the specials.

78
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.000
They might be a little bit
squeezed in terms of size.

79
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.570
And everything else
basically stays the same.

80
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.470
Now, however, when we jump to going to a
mobile page, that becomes very different.

81
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.770
Now we're not going to have
these buttons anymore,

82
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.290
we're going to have a kind of
a menu that our user can click, and

83
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.030
the menu can slide down,
which is a very common feature.

84
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.030
You also notice,

85
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.460
that we moved the telephone number
in the middle of the page now.

86
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.000
Because supposedly on the mobile web page,

87
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.100
right you would want to, have the phone
number just a click away, or a tap away.

88
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.060
And we're going to have
this phone number tappable,

89
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.150
such that they can Make a phone
call straight from the page or

90
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.700
it will at least trigger their phone
to try to call the restaurant.

91
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.960
And we'll still have the jumbotron but
it's going to be much smaller one

92
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.460
because we don't want to overwhelm
the phone and the cell network.

93
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.610
We don't want it to be too slow.

94
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.440
And you can see here that now this
thing is a little bit rearranged.

95
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.230
We have the menu and the specials but

96
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.980
the map is now on the bottom
of those two things.

97
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.210
So we're going to have to figure out
how to have the map automatically slide

98
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.450
underneath of that.

99
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.290
And we're still going to have some
testimonials about the restaurant,

100
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.230
the hours, and the address.

101
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.980
Now, that's really not
all we need to design.

102
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.505
We also need to design another page and

103
00:05:28.505 --> 00:05:31.705
we know up front we're going to
have this menu categories page.

104
00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:35.125
Well in the menu categories page and
this is showing us the full one it

105
00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.725
is going to basically have
a bunch of different things.

106
00:05:37.725 --> 00:05:42.575
And here it looks like we're going
to have six menu categories across.

107
00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:47.015
And it's basically going to continue until
we run out of these menu categories.

108
00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:50.310
So that's basically what we're not
going to have a jumbotron here,

109
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.100
because at this point they're all ready
a little bit deeper into the website.

110
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.160
And the other is a menu list,
so we're going to have,

111
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.940
supposedly they will click on one of the
menu categories and they will see every

112
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.578
item inside that menu category, and
this is basically what we have.

113
00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:09.290
So we're going to have a couple
of items across with their name,

114
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.810
with their description, and we're also
going to have a ID for every single item.

115
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.290
And that ID if you look, if you remember,
let me go back to the restaurant.

116
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.820
They would choose China Bistro and
that ID really comes from right here.

117
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.750
Every menu item has this ID that
is already on their menu so

118
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.730
we don't want to switch that back and
forth.

119
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.450
We want to keep that side so

120
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.500
the menu will correspond to
something that's on the website.

121
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.590
Okay, so that's our layout.

122
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.240
Next, let's take a look at some design
that has already some colors and

123
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.940
some more concrete layout.

124
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.540
So here's what our designer came up with.

125
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.090
This is just a basic idea,

126
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.400
this is what you are usually going
to get back from a designer.

127
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.720
You're going to get some
kind of a color scheme.

128
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.780
Some photography.

129
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.930
And the photography is not from
this particular restaurant.

130
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.030
It's just some stock photography
that you can certainly use

131
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.970
in order to kind of enhance
the site to see what it looks like.

132
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:08.860
And here's our menu.

133
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.470
Again, this is not the menu from
this particular restaurant, or

134
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.450
not the pictures from a particular
restaurant, but the map is.

135
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.470
So this is what we're going for.

136
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.620
Designer will typically provide for
you the hexodus more color values for

137
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.440
different components within your website,
and

138
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.795
it will also tell you which fonts
that they used inside this design.

139
00:07:31.795 --> 00:07:35.315
Now depending on your budget and
if you're trying to do things for free or

140
00:07:35.315 --> 00:07:37.795
certainly trying to find free resources,

141
00:07:37.795 --> 00:07:41.215
I'll recommend the prompt that you
try to stick with Google fonts.

142
00:07:41.215 --> 00:07:44.280
There's a website Google.com/fonts.

143
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.740
And which we'll be using for
our website ourselves.

144
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.360
So if you could ask your designer to
stick to the fonts that are available

145
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.250
on that website, it will make your job
down the line a little bit easier.

146
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.430
Now don't worry about
making minor mistakes,

147
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.990
at least with the color scheme and
other things like that.

148
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.250
For example, we messed up on this site by

149
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.310
not providing the designer the photography
up front because we just couldn't.

150
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.930
We didn't really arrange it that way.

151
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.820
We only did the photography
after the design was produced.

152
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.450
Which was not really under our control,

153
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.630
simply because that's the way
the schedules worked out.

154
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.390
But when we started comparing the photos
that we were able to get from the food

155
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.470
photography realize that
the color scheme especially for

156
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.490
this color right here, the reddish color,
is really the wrong one.

157
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.660
So we have two choices, we could colorize
every single picture that we took with

158
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.620
this red, and you were able to do
something less in Photoshop, or

159
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.450
just adjust our color,
this particular color, slightly so

160
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.880
that it will fit the color scheme that the
restaurant actually presents in real life.

161
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.940
And in this case our
color scheme kind of went

162
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.180
close together with the color of
the napkins in the restaurant.

163
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.000
Now what tool do you use do design this?

164
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.915
Well professional designers usually use
Photoshop, Adobe Photoshop to design this,

165
00:08:56.915 --> 00:08:59.525
but you don't really have
to use something so fancy.

166
00:08:59.525 --> 00:09:03.265
You can use something as simple as
PowerPoint or any drawing tool.

167
00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:07.550
Because the idea here isn't to come
with with a complete 100% design

168
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.610
The idea here is really to
come up with enough detail so

169
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.810
when you code you will know
what you are trying to achieve.

170
00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.400
And that is what basically this is about.

171
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.220
So we have our mock ups, we have our
design with the colors and the fonts.

172
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.170
It's time to start coding the website.

173
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.799
Let's do it.
